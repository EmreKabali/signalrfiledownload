# File Download with SignalR and Hangfire


This project demonstrates how to use SignalR and Hangfire in a .NET application to queue file downloads and trigger them even when users are on different screens. The download process is initiated in the background using Hangfire, while SignalR ensures real-time communication with the client to notify them when the download is ready.

## Features
Queue File Downloads: Files are added to a download queue using Hangfire's background jobs.

Real-Time Notification: SignalR notifies the user when the download is ready, even if they have navigated to a different screen.

Delayed Download Start: The download begins automatically after a specified delay.


## Technologies Used
ASP.NET Core: The core framework for building the application.

SignalR: For real-time communication, ensuring that users are notified of the download status in real-time.

Hangfire: For background job processing, enabling queuing and delayed execution of the download process.

Entity Framework Core: For database operations (if applicable in your project).

Bootstrap: For responsive front-end design.

JavaScript: To handle client-side operations such as triggering downloads.
Installation


Set up your database (if applicable) using Entity Framework Core migrations:


## How It Works
File Download Request: The user initiates a file download by clicking a button.

Queue the Download: The request is added to the Hangfire queue as a background job.

Real-Time Updates: Using SignalR, the server communicates with the client in real-time. Even if the user navigates to a different page, they will be notified when the download is ready.

Download the File: After the download is queued and the delay passes, the file download begins automatically.
